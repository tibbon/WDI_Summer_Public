## Assigned 06/20/2013

### Read about Classes and Objects
* Remember, that a class is a description, and an object is an "instance" of a class
* Read class notes on [objects](./resources/wdi-objects.pdf?raw=true)
* [Here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_object_oriented.htm), read up
  to, but *not* including, the *Operator Overloading* section (i.e., don't read that section or below) 
### Read about Exceptions, File I/O, and Testing
* *Skim* class notes on [all three concepts](./resources/exceptions_file_io_and_tdd.pdf?raw=true). 
  * *Skim these notes.* 
  * We'll be going over them in detail on Friday, but we thought seeing them ahead of time could 
    be useful.
  * Don't try to run the code, but just try to follow along with the examples as written. 
* Optional: 
  * Watch this code school on 
    [Testing with Rspec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec). *Don't* 
    worry about the specific syntax or terminology, rather try and understand the general 
    approach to test driven development they take.

### Finish the HappyTail assignment

  * Work through git with your 
  [collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-add-a-collaborator).
